# Course-work
Course work on C++  
The program's functionality consists in creating/editing/deleting files with information about students + graphical display of data from files and the possibility of interactive interaction.  
Additional functionality is the possibility of displaying students by their faculty or course and having a built-in dictionary.  
All tasks that were set have been implemented.  
Since the project was made in 2018, unfortunately, documentation with a full description has not been preserved.
